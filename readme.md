**Problem Description:**
-----------------------
Datasets for machine learning varies in a number of perspectives and requires specificpreprocessing progress and different optimal training models. Things will be more complicatedand time-consuming for engineers to solve multitask.General 

**Idea:**
---------
Auto machine will be applied at this status to solve this problem. Generally, codes will beperformed in a pipeline manner and will be divided into several parts: preprocessing, featureselection, model selection, training and estimation. Group members will be assigned to makecontributions on different parts. Each part of our code will fit all the datasets, so that we can trainall of our different datasets altogether for different tasks.

**Instruction:**
----------------
1. Use Google Colab to open the .ipynb file
2. Use this link to get the data
3. Set Google Colab to GPU mode: Edit->Note Setting->Hardware Accelerator->GPU
4. Run the entire document and the performances of the four Kaggle competitions are showed at bottom

**Reference Dataset:**
