**Problem Description:**
-----------------------
Datasets for machine learning varies in a number of perspectives and requires specific preprocessing progress and different optimal training models. Things will be more complicated and time-consuming for engineers to solve multitask.

**General Idea:**
---------------
Auto machine will be applied at this status to solve this problem. Generally, code will be performed in a pipeline manner and will be divided into several parts: preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection and estimation. Group members will be assigned to make contributions on different parts. Each part of our code will fit all the datasets, so that we can train all of our different datasets altogether for different tasks.

**Instruction:**
----------------
1. Use Google Colab to open the ml_pipeline.ipynb file
2. Use this link to get the data, you must use your **NYU EMAIL ACCOUNT** https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L-4hnYBN1T80cbnWL19PMipM8z6NOHVC?usp=sharing and add to your **OWN** Google Drive
3. Set Google Colab to GPU mode: Edit -> Note Setting -> Hardware Accelerator -> **GPU**
4. Run the entire document and the performances of the four Kaggle competitions are showed at bottom
5. You may encounter two authentifications, click on the link and paste the passcode to the blanck area and press "Enter"

**Reference Dataset:**
