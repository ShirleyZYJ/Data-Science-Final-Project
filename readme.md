**Problem Description:**
-----------------------
Datasets for machine learning varies in a number of perspectives and requires specific preprocessing progress and different optimal training models. Things will be more complicated and time-consuming for engineers to solve multitask.

**General Idea:**
---------------
Auto machine will be applied at this status to solve this problem. Generally, codes will be performed in a pipeline manner and will be divided into several parts: preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection and estimation. Group members will be assigned to make contributions on different parts. Each part of our code will fit all the datasets, so that we can trainall of our different datasets altogether for different tasks.

**Instruction:**
----------------
1. Use Google Colab to open the .ipynb file
2. Use this link to get the data
3. Set Google Colab to GPU mode: Edit -> Note Setting -> Hardware Accelerator -> GPU
4. Run the entire document and the performances of the four Kaggle competitions are showed at bottom

**Reference Dataset:**
-------------------
Datasets published on Kaggle.com.
